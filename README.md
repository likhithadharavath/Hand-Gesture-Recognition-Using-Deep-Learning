# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning

*Hand Gesture Recognition Using Deep Learning ✋🤖
This project focuses on recognizing hand gestures using deep learning techniques. It is designed to accurately classify different hand gestures captured through images or video streams. Such systems can be used for Human-Computer Interaction, Sign Language Translation, and Contactless Control Applications.

🚀 Features
✅ Real-time hand gesture detection and classification
✅ Deep learning model for high accuracy gesture recognition
✅ Supports multiple gesture classes
✅ Preprocessing techniques for improved robustness
✅ Clean and modular code structure
✅ Easily scalable for new gesture classes
✅ Visualization of predictions (optional - if implemented)
